### TRANSMISSION ### 📡

Stop wrestling with window borders. XResize is a lightweight, high-speed utility for the X11 desktop environment, designed to give you surgical control over your workspace. 🤖 Summon the resize interface with a keypress, input your target dimensions, and execute. Your window obeys.

This tool is built for speed, precision, and minimal distraction, integrating directly with your window manager via wmctrl and xdotool.

### FEATURES ### ✨

⚡ Hotkey Driven: Summon the resize prompt with Left-Ctrl + Space.

🎯 Active Window Targeting: Automatically detects and targets the window you're currently using.

⌨️ Intuitive Input: Accepts dimensions in WIDTHxHEIGHT or WIDTH HEIGHT formats (e.g., 1920x1080 or 1920 1080).

💅 Sleek UI: A minimal, frameless, futuristic-themed prompt (built with PySide6) that appears, does its job, and vanishes.

✅ Instant Execution: Press Enter to resize or Esc to abort.

⛔ ### VITAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENT ### ⛔

This application interfaces directly with the X Window System.

🖥️ PLATFORM: This tool is designed only for Linux systems running X11.

🚫 INCOMPATIBILITY: It will not function on Wayland, Windows, or macOS.

🔧 DEPENDENCIES: Requires wmctrl and xdotool to be installed on the host system.

🐧 PRIMARY OS: Developed and tested on Ubuntu (X11 Session).
